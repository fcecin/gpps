General Purpose Permanent Storage (GPPS) is a smart contract that allows users to store arbitrary binary data in Antelope RAM

This contract is deployed on the UX Network and is ready to be used there: https://explorer.uxnetwork.io/account/datastoreutx. At the time of this writing (December 2022) that deployed smart contract is not set to immutable yet, but at some point it will.

Brocli (https://github.com/fcecin/brocli) is a Node.JS web application that can be modified and/or deployed to demonstrate a simple use of the GPPS contract. 

For an online demo of Brocli using GPPS on UX Network, try https://brocli.nearlyfreespeech.net, which may be running a Brocli deployment.
